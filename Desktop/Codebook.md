## Subset all data except Subject, Activity and X Columns
## The columns for Mean and Standard Devaition are given in features.txt
## For example columns 1 to 6 of X, give tBodyAcc-mean()-X, tBodyAcc-mean()-Y, tBodyAcc-mean()-Z, tBodyAcc-std()-X, tBodyAcc-std()-Y
## tBodyAcc-std()-Z
##
## STEP 4
##
## Rename Activities to meaningful names as in activity_lables.txt
# 1 WALKING, 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 SITTING, 5 STANDING, 6 LYING
